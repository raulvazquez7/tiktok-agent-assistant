# Black Code Formatting Rules for Python

- Adhere strictly to the Black code style. Black is non-negotiable and has minimal configuration.
- Default line length is 88 characters.
- Use double quotes (`"`) for strings where possible, but Black will handle consistency.
- Black handles indentation, whitespace, trailing commas, and line breaks automatically.
- Ensure code passes `black .` check before committing.
- Integrate Black into your pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipeline.

## Example Integration (pre-commit)
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
-   repo: <https://github.com/psf/black>
    rev: 23.3.0 # Use a recent stable version
    hooks:
    -   id: black
