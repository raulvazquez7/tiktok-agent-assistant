When suggesting Python code and the task is mainly I/O-bound (e.g. HTTP requests, database access, disk or network I/O), first recommend a well-structured asynchronous version.

Use async/await with mature libraries 

Flag any code that would block the event loop, and suggest run_in_threadpool or another strategy.

Briefly mention the expected benefit (e.g. lower latency, higher throughput) and the requirements

If the added complexity outweighs the benefit (e.g. for a short script or a single call), explain why staying synchronous might be more pragmatic.
